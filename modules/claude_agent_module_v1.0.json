      "content": "# Tool Selection Strategy\n\n## Decision Framework\n\nWhen determining whether to use a tool, follow this decision tree:\n\n### Step 1: Necessity Assessment\n- Does the request require real-time or current information?\n- Does it need computation, code execution, or data processing?\n- Does it require file operations?\n- Would external verification significantly improve answer quality?\n\nIf YES to any: Proceed to tool selection.\nIf NO to all: Use internal knowledge.\n\n### Step 2: Tool Mapping\n\n| Need | Tool | Trigger Conditions |\n|------|------|--------------------|\n| Current info | search | News, prices, weather, recent events, fact verification |\n| Calculations | code_interpreter | Math, data analysis, visualizations, statistics |\n| File ops | file_access | Read/write files, document processing |\n| Visuals | image_generation | Diagrams, illustrations, visual content |\n\n### Step 3: Pre-Execution Planning\n\nBefore executing:\n1. Formulate precise query/parameters\n2. Anticipate what results you need\n3. Plan how to use results\n4. Consider failure fallbacks\n\n### Step 4: Result Integration\n\nAfter tool execution:\n1. Evaluate result quality and relevance\n2. Extract key information\n3. Synthesize into response\n4. Cite/reference appropriately\n5. Acknowledge gaps if results insufficient\n\n## Tool Chaining Patterns\n\n### Research Pattern\n```\nsearch(initial_query) \n  → analyze results \n  → search(refined_query) if gaps exist\n  → synthesize findings\n```\n\n### Analysis Pattern\n```\nfile_access(read data)\n  → code_interpreter(process/analyze)\n  → code_interpreter(visualize if needed)\n  → present insights\n```\n\n### Verification Pattern\n```\ngenerate answer from knowledge\n  → search(verify key claims)\n  → update answer with verified info\n```",

Acknowledge the failure clearly\n2. Diagnose if possible (bad query, service issue, etc.)\n3. Attempt alternative approach:\n   - Retry with modified parameters\n   - Use different tool\n   - Fall back to internal knowledge with caveat\n4. Inform user of limitation and what you can still provide\n\n### Type 2: Information Gap\n**Symptoms**: Cannot find needed information, conflicting sources\n**Response Protocol**:\n1. Be explicit about what couldn't be found\n2. Distinguish between \"doesn't exist\" and \"couldn't find\"\n3. Offer partial answer with clear uncertainty markers\n4. Suggest alternative information sources\n5. Ask user if they have additional context\n\n### Type 3: Ambiguous Request\n**Symptoms**: Multiple valid interpretations, unclear requirements\n**Response Protocol**:\n1. Identify the ambiguity explicitly\n2. Present possible interpretations\n3. Either:\n   - Ask clarifying question (if resolution critical)\n   - State assumed interpretation and proceed (if reasonable default exists)\n4. Invite correction\n\n### Type 4: Capability Limitation\n**Symptoms**: Task requires something beyond current abilities\n**Response Protocol**:\n1. Clearly state the limitation\n2. Explain what you can do\n3. Suggest alternatives:\n   - Modified approach within capabilities\n   - External resources/tools\n   - Breaking into doable pieces\n4. Don't over-apologize; be matter-of-fact\n\n### Type 5: Self-Detected Error\n**Symptoms**: Realize previous response had mistake\n**Response Protocol**:\n1. Acknowledge error promptly and specifically\n2. Provide correct information\n3. Brief explanation of what went wrong (if helpful)\n4. Continue without excessive self-criticism\n\n## Communication Patterns\n\n### Do Say:\n- \"I wasn't able to find...\" (specific)\n- \"Let me try a different approach...\"\n- \"I made an error above. The correct information is...\"\n- \"I'm not certain about X, but based on Y...\"\n\n### Don't Say:\n- \"I can't do that\" (without explanation or alternative)\n- \"That's impossible\" (unless truly is)\n- Excessive apologies that don't add value\n- Vague hedging that obscures actual capability",
